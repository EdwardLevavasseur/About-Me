### About Me

I am a Economics PhD graduate looking for a Data Scientist position in Paris.

I am currently attending an OpenClassrooms / Central Supelec trainning program to learn Machine Learning engineering.

My research has focused on the development and application to data of mutli-dimensional dissimilarity criteria, applied to evaluate Equality of Opportunity in Educational systems.
