    <p> My research in Economics has focused on the evaluation of Equality of Opportunity in Educational Systems, by applying multi-dimensional dominance criteria to educational data. In particular I have developped equality of opportunity criteria derived from Zonotopes and multi-dimensional stochastic dominance. The empirical applications have required the development of statistical inference methods, and of policy evaluation methods adapted to such multi-dimensional dominance criteria.</p>
